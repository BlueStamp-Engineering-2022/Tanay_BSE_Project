# Wall-E robot
My project is the Wall-E robot. This is a robot that will display emotions based off how far something is. I decided tomake a pig instead of a Wall-E to add a fun aspect.

# Final Milestone
My third milestone and final modification was making a pig. This pig is called Porky the Pig and it was inspired by the minecraft pig. This pig will change emotions based on how far or how close something is. I added two different stages which are an angry stage and a happy stage which can be changed based on an android app. I enjoyed learning many different electrical engineering techniques such as wiring, soldering, hardware etc. I also enjoyed working with the servo because it was guess and check and I thought it was really fun. I struggled with the wiring because whenever I put it in the box it, the wiring was loose so I had to redo the wiring multiple times.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was distance and instead of printing it on the LCD monitor, I got the LED to change emotions. If it cannot detect how far it is, it will be in a neutral form. I also got the bluetooth to connect with my phone and stay connected all the time. I also got each of the servo to connect and move based on how far or how close something is. I made a range for each distance based and set that to a stage such as happy, surprised, neutral, etc. With this I made a method for each one of these and then made the servo to move based on those. I also got my eyebrows servo to connect to the analog pins and make them move as well. Something that didn’t work too well was my LED. While trying to get them to work, I didn’t understand how to connect both of them, so only one of my LED would project the correct emotion and the other would blank out at times. I had to fix this by resetting both of the LED and not just the first one. Something that worked very well was the servo, I got them to connect very easily and made them move. I had to guess and check to see where it would move, but in the end I got it to work. I had a modification in mind where I am going to use the box as the body and have the LED as the eyes, ultrasonic sensor as the nose, and the LCD as my mouth.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to get a sensor to detect how far something is and print it on the LCD. We got it to print the distance in centimeters and project it on the LCD. Something I enjoyed a lot was the wiring and soldering because I really enjoyed doing this since it was hands on. Something I did that I struggled with was the code. We didn’t know how to code it and after a lot of research we got it to work. We had to use a variation for Liquid Crystal to get it to work. I also struggled with following instructions because I soldered something wrong on the wave shield causing it to break. The next step is to attach all the wiring along with the wave shield.

# Starter Project
The project that I built for my starter project is called TV-B-Gone Kit. Starting from the base which is the circuit board. It provides a place where all the connections take place. Going on up we have the power switch, and a green light indicator to show if it works or not. Two resistors were used to regulate the flow of electrical current. A ceramic capacitor was used for high stability performances and low-loss devices. The Ceramic oscillator was used as a signal generator in electronic circuitry followed by an oscillator. The oscillator is the timeclock for the microcontroller, making sure that it is performing its functions at the correct speed. The battery holder holds and transmits power for the rest of the build. The last piece that was used was IR LEDs which emit light in the infrared range of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. One of the main things that I enjoyed was soldering. Soldering was very interesting and satisfied me. I thought it was also cool because I always dreamed of soldering. One thing I struggled with at first was adding too much solder. I had to go back and remove some, but besides that I think everything went well.
